## üîÑ Workflow

1. **User Query**:
   - Users input queries like "How are carousel posts performing?" or select post types for analysis via the Streamlit interface.

2. **Data Retrieval**:
   - Relevant social media engagement data (likes, shares, comments) is fetched securely from **[DataStax Astra DB](https://astra.datastax.com/)**.

3. **Data Processing**:
   - The data is filtered and processed based on user input. For example:
     - The `Post ID` is extracted if required.
     - Metrics such as average likes or comments are calculated for different post types.

4. **AI-Powered Insights**:
   - The processed data is sent to **[LangFlow](https://www.langflow.org/)**, which leverages **[OpenAI GPT](https://openai.com/chatgpt/overview/)** to generate insights such as "Carousel posts have 20% higher engagement compared to images."  

5. **Visualization**:
   - Insights and metrics are visualized interactively using **[Plotly](https://plotly.com/)** on the dashboard.

This streamlined workflow ensures users can seamlessly analyze and gain actionable insights into social media performance.
